# txtDataNLP

### txtDataNLP is a lightweight Java framework for Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects.

Typical use cases include:
*	Combining various third-party NLP and Machine Learning (ML) tools into one setup.
*	Implementing algorithms that combine output from various NLP or ML modules and return one coherent analysisâ€”also if their output is contradictory.
*	Implementing dictionary-based, ontology-based or linguistically motivated approaches to NLP.
*	Extraction of features from low-level NLP tools (tokenizers, taggers) for downstream ML models.
*	Implementing white- or backlists that often sit on top of ML approaches in order to deal with specific mistakes of the ML models.
